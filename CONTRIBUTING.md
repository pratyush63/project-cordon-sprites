# Sprites

**As a general rule of thumb, please check the current sprites to gain an idea of our art style.**

## General

- Original content

## Size

- tag [Icon](https://github.com/doficia/project-cordon-sprites/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aicon): 128x128 (canvas size; the object does not have to take all space - the larger the sexier though!)
- tag [World](https://github.com/doficia/project-cordon-sprites/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aworld): 48x48 (same as above; for tall objects such as trees the 48px height limit can be extended)
- tag [World-X2](https://github.com/doficia/project-cordon-sprites/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aworld-x2): 96x96 (same as above)
- tag [Tile](https://github.com/doficia/project-cordon-sprites/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atile): 64x64 (tileable both horizontally and vertically unless stated otherwise)

## Format

- transparent background
- PNG format

## Style

- Pixel-art (1x1 pixels)
- Realistic style
- Small palettes

## Don'ts

- no transparency - alpha value is either 0 or 255
- no strong outlines
- no photorealism
- no gradients

## Icon Tag

Icons are very likely to be a part of the UI, such as inventory images of items. This means the object can be drawn from any angle without any restrictions.

## World Tag

Objects with the tag World are to be part of the ingame world. Shocking, huh? We feature an **isometric** (or 3/4) view, so please make sure the sprite is in the correct angle.

## World-X2 Tag

Same as World, size can be up to twice as large.

## File Location

As long as you put your sprite in the sprites/ folder, it is fine. Place where it feels logical within, but we will take care of sorting that.
